# Note: I accidentally put two of the same project into this repository. Only open the most recently updated one.

I attempted to include the following endpoints alongside the main one, but ended up giving up on it:
  - Abilities: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/ability/
  - Forms: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon-form/
  - Game Appearances: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/version/
  - Moves: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/move/
  - Stats: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/stat/

I had to give up on more features to make the project presentable. These included:
  - Detailed ability display
  - Detailed movepool display
  - The ability to view the pokemon's other forms (Mega Evolutions, G-Max, etc.)
  - Display that allowed to view both male and female sprites
  - A cool custom theme that used hex codes for colors.
